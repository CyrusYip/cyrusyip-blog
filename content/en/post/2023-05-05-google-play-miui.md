China Xiaomi/Redmi phones in [Google Play supported devices](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131) have built-in Google Services. We just need to install Google Play. This tutorial works for Redmi K40S and Mi 11 LE on MIUI 14.

1. Turn on Google Services: Settings -> Account & sync -> Basic Google Services
1. Install Google Play: search "google play" on GetApps and update "Google Play Store". If Google Play isn't found on GetApps, install it from [Aptoide](https://en.aptoide.com/).

Now you should find Play Store on the home screen.

<!--
P.S. In my first attempt, I found no Google Play on GetApps and installed it from Aptoide. However, I find it on GetApps now. This is weird.
