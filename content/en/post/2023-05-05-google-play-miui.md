China Xiaomi / Redmi phones in [Google Play supported devices](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131)[^devices] have built-in Google Services. We just need to install Google Play.

[^devices]: It's not prerequisite. Google Play is possible to be installed on phones not in the list.

1. Turn on Google Services
    - MIUI: Settings -> Account & sync -> Basic Google Services
    - HyperOS: Settings -> Additional settings -> Account & sync -> Basic Google Services
1. Install Google Play: search "google play" on GetApps and update "Google Play Store". If Google Play isn't found on GetApps, install it from [Aptoide](https://en.aptoide.com/).

Now you should find Play Store on the home screen.

This tutorial was tested on Mi 11 LE, Redmi K40S, Redmi Note 12 Turbo and Xiaomi 14.

Thanks to [Shitao Wu](https://shitao5.org/) for testing Xiaomi 14 (HyperOS).

Xiaomi 14
HyperOS: 1.0.19.0.UNCCNXM

P.S. In my first attempt, I found no Google Play on GetApps and installed it from Aptoide. However, I find it on GetApps now. This is weird.
