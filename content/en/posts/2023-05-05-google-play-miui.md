## Guide

China Xiaomi / Redmi phones in [Google Play supported devices](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1727131)[^devices] have built-in Google Services. We just need to install Google Play.

[^devices]: It's not prerequisite. Google Play is possible to be installed on phones not in the list.

1. Turn on Google Services
    - MIUI: Settings -> Account & sync -> Basic Google Services
    - HyperOS: Settings -> Additional settings -> Account & sync -> Basic Google Services
1. Install Google Play: search "google play" on GetApps, and install or update "Google Play Store". If Google Play isn't found on GetApps, install it from [Aptoide](https://en.aptoide.com/).

Now you should find Play Store on the home screen.

This tutorial was tested on Redmi K40S, Redmi Note 12 Turbo, Redmi Turbo 3, Mi 11 LE, and Xiaomi 14.

Thanks to [Shitao Wu](https://shitao5.org/) for testing Xiaomi 14 (HyperOS).

## Notice

This guide may not work for some phones. I don't know which phones it doesn't work for. You need to to try it by yourself.

If you haven't buy the phone you want, you can:

- Try this guide on the phone in a Xiaomi Store.
- Buy a refundable phone online and try it.
- Search online to see if someone succeeded with the phone you want.
- Ask online if this guide works for the phone you want.

If you have already bought the phone but this guide doesn't work for you, you can:

- Return or sell it, and buy another one.
- Unlock the bootloader and flash a custom ROM bundled with Google Play (this is quite complicated for average users. If you want to try, check [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/) and [xiaomi.eu](https://xiaomi.eu/community/)).

Xiaomi 14
HyperOS: 1.0.19.0.UNCCNXM

Redmi Turbo 3
HyperOS: 1.0.14.0 UNPCNXM

P.S. In my first attempt, I found no Google Play on GetApps and installed it from Aptoide. However, I find it on GetApps now. This is weird.
