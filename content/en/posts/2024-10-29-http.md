## Introduction

HTTP (**H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) is a protocol for transferring information, such as HTML files. It's the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. In a typical HTTP session, the client (such as a browser) sends a request to the server, which sends back a response.

## HTTP Request

A typical HTTP request consists of:

1. request line (request method, path, protocol version)
1. request header
1. empty line
1. optional message body

Here is an example of HTTP request message (`curl --verbose https://cyrusyip.org/en/`):

```text
GET /en/ HTTP/2
Host: cyrusyip.org
User-Agent: curl/8.10.1
Accept: */*

```

### HTTP Request Methods

HTTP request methods (also called HTTP verbs) indicate the purpose of the request and what to expect. Here are the common request methods:

- `GET`: request the specified resource
- `POST`: sends information to the server

## HTTP Response

A typical HTTP response consists of:

1. status line (protocol version, status code, optional explanation of status code)
1. response header
1. empty line
1. optional message body

Here is an example of HTTP response message (`curl --verbose https://example.com/`):

```text

### HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that indicate whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. They are grouped in five classes:

- [1xx (Informational)](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#status.1xx): The request was received, continuing process.
- [2xx (Successful)](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#status.2xx): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- [3xx (Redirection)](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#status.3xx): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
- [4xx (Client Error)](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#status.4xx): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
- [5xx (Server Error)](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#status.5xx): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

Here are some commonly used HTTP status codes:

- `103 Early Hints`: This status code lets the user agent preload resources while the server prepares a response.
- `200 OK`: The request succeeded.
- `301 Moved Permanently`: The URL of the requested resource has been *permanently* changed.
- `302 Found`: The URL of the requested resource has been *temporarily* changed.
- `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have access permission to the resource.
- `404 Not Found`: The server cannot find the requested resource.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: The server has encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: The server is not ready to handle the request. It may be down for maintenance, or it may be overloaded.
