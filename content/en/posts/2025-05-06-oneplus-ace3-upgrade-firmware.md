My OnePlus Ace 3 runs on PixelOS, which doesn't include the firmware, so I need to upgrade the firmware by myself.

Firmware is installed via fastboot and fastbootd, so we need to test them:

1. Connect the phone to the computer
1. Press the volume-down button and power button to enter fastboot
1. Run `fastboot devices`, and make sure the phone is in fastboot
1. Run `fastboot reboot fastboot` to enter fastbootd
1. Run `fastboot devices`, and make sure the phone is in fastbootd

My phone runs on PixelOS_aston-15.0-20250424 with PJE110_15.0.0.500 firmware, and I want to upgrade the firmware to PJE110_15.0.0.701.

Installation steps:

1. Press the volume-down button and power button to enter fastboot.
1. Download the firmware from [this link](https://github.com/inferno0230/op12r-fw-repo/releases). I will download [PJE110_15.0.0.701](https://github.com/inferno0230/op12r-fw-repo/releases/tag/PJE110_15.0.0.701(CN01))ã€‚Extract the file.
1. Run `install_images.sh` on Linux/macOS, `install_images.bat` on Windows.
