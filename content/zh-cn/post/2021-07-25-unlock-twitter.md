Twitter 也太坑了，我刚注册完，一登陆就锁定[我帐号](https://twitter.com/CyrusYip10)。联系客服解锁一个月后又锁定了。解锁要我验证手机号，可中国手机号也收不到验证码。罢了，反正我也不想绑定手机号。还是照旧发邮件让客服解锁。点击 [Contact Us](https://help.twitter.com/en/forms) 里的 [Locked and suspend account issues](https://help.twitter.com/forms/general?subtopic=suspended) 就可以联系客服了，在 Description of problem 填入以下内容：

> Dear Sir or Madam.
>
> My account was locked, but I did not violate the Twitter Rules at all. I just tweeted several times and followed one account. I can not use China phone number to verify because it can not receive confirmation code. Please help me to unlock my account. This account was locked second time. Could you tell me why my account was locked twice.
>
> Thank you in advance.

然后马上就收到自动回复说我违反了 [Twitter 规则](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules)：

> We’re writing to let you know that your account has been flagged for unusual behavior that violates [the Twitter Rules](https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules), and has been locked until you take the following steps...

我看了规则内容，我也只是正常使用，并未违反规则。此时要再申诉一次，还是填原来的内容。这次才收到回复说会继续审核申诉：

> Thanks for your report. It looks like this is connected with your  original case # 16409264056, so we’ve added it to that first report.
>
> We’ll continue our review with this information.

我的申诉内容除去客套话，真正有效的部分应该是这些：

> My account was locked, but I did not violate the Twitter Rules at all.  I can not use China phone number to verify because it can not receive confirmation code. Please help me to unlock my account.

也许第二句也可以省略掉：

> My account was locked, but I did not violate the Twitter Rules at all.  Please help me to unlock my account.

如果你也遇到了一样的问题，可以试试发这些内容，可根据自己情况作改动。
